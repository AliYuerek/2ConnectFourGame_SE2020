2ConnectFourGame_SE2020

I assure you that I set up this project all by myself. I have used this project to improve my programming skills.

Here is a short manual for the game:

1. The game starts.
2. The players enter their name (If they want).
3. If the player does not know how to play the game, there is a short instruction in the menu. If the player wants to leave the application during a game, there is also an exit button in the menu.
4. At the bottom left is the name of the player whose turn it is. The player makes his move by clicking on the desired field. EXTRA FEATURE: If one player clicks on the wrong field, the other player is automatically in turn. 
5. When a Player has won, a new window appears. The new window gives information about the loser. Afterwards the players are       forced to end the game.
6. The game is ended.
